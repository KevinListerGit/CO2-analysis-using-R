# CO2-analysis-using-R
This module analyises the seasonal amplitude change of the Mauna Loa CO2 data

The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the annual cycles in the Mauna Loa data set, with a particular focus on the effect of global atmospheric CO2 concentrations from the Mount Pinatubo erruption in June 1991. The hypothesesis is that this caused a reduction of the CO2 and can be used as an analogue to CO2 removal through ocean fertilisation

We now recalcuate the ampltidude by adding the underlying change to the amplitude of the Winter to Summer cycle

We see from the graph above that whilst the Mount Pinatubo erruption would appear to have caused an immediate reduction of the CO2 in
winter to summer cycle this was not sustained and the absorption in the following years was lower, suggesting a maximum rate of absorption
had been obtained. 


And we recalculate the amplitdue by subtracting the underlying change from the amplitude of the Summer to Winter cycle

The steadily increasing trend could be reflecting lower absorption of the CO2 by the ecosytem as the planet continues to warm. The peak in 2016/17
may be due to an El Nino.
